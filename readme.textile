h1. Adaptive Images (extended)

Is a solution to automatically create, cache, and deliver device-appropriate versions of your website's content images. It is intended for use with "Responsive Designs":http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design and to be combined with "Fluid Image":http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images/ techniques.

h2. Benefits

* Ensures you and your visitors are not wasting bandwidth delivering images at a higher resolution than the vistor needs.
* Is device agnostic (it works by detecting the size of the visitors screen)
* Is CMS agnostic (it manages its own image re-sizing, and will work on any CMS or even on flat HTML pages)
* Highly configurable
** Choose where you want the cached files to be stored
** Configure directories to ignore (protect certain directories so AI is not applied to images within them)

h2. Install

Copy the adaptive-images folder at the root-folder.
Make sure, the permission of the adaptive-images folder is 755.
Copy the .htaccess at the root-folder or copy its code in an existing .htaccess file.

h2. Description

h3. The easy original "Adaptive Images" behavior:

&#060;img src="image.jpg" /&#062;

The original "Adaptive Images" by Matt Wilcox.
This will resizes every image on the rewrite conditions (.htaccess). The size 
of the image will be the one value of the $config['resolutions'] that is equal 
or closest higher than the device maximum width. You can enable this behavior 
by setting $config['enable_resolutions'] = TRUE. Then all images without a 
size-parameter will be sized by the original behavior of "Adaptive Images".

h3. The more spezific behavior:

&#060;img src="image.jpg?size=term" /&#062;

*Breakpoints and sizes*
Now you can define, what size an image has to have on spezific configurable 
breakpoints equal to your media-queries. Just start with an default 
breakpoint  and size 0. If you do not setup another breakpoint higher than 0, 
the image will be this size on every device-dimensions. You can set the 
width in pixel or percentage. If you use for instance 100% in this case, 
the image will be 100% the size of the resolution, that is equal or 
closest higher than the device maximum width, but maximum width of the 
larges configured resolution.

*Cropping (cutting to fit)*
You can define an aspect ratio for a term. 
All depending images will be cropped.

*Sharpen*
You can define the amount of sharpness for a term. 0 is no sharpness, 
up to 30 is pleasant, higher than 30 is really sharp (max 500).

*JPEG quality*
You can define the JPEG quality for a term from 100, which is best, 
down to 70, which is pleasant.

*Prevent cache*
For developping, you might will see changes of the setup on every 
page-reload. Then setup:
$config['browser_cache'] = 0;
$config['prevent_cache'] = TRUE;

*Debug mode*
This inserts some informations into the image.
* image dimensions
* the aspect ratio
* the device-width
